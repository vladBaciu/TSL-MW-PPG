Blood Pressure Measurement based on Four-wavelength PPG Signals
This dataset was collected primarily to explore the role of PPG signals with different wavelengths in the prediction of cuffless blood pressure. The PPG signals are collected at the human index finger which are the reflex type. This dataset can be used to study data mining of PPG signals with different wavelengths, or it can be used to build novel cuffless blood pressure measurement models using single or multiple PPG signals.
The dataset contains four-wavelength PPG signals and blood pressure values measured by OMRON HEM-7201. There are data files "ppg_data" and physiological information files in the dataset. The physiological information files are saved as an Excel document named as "Subject Information.xlsx". SBP and DBP represent systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. SBP and DBP were measured before PPG signal collection and PPG signal collection begins immediately after blood pressure measurement. 
The dataset contains a total of 180 subjects, each with 60 seconds signal length and 200 Hz sampling frequency. The wavelength information of signals in the dataset is listed as follows：
channel1: 660nm
channel2: 730nm
channel3: 850nm
channel4: 940nm  -> deleted

The above dataset is collected and managed by CardioWorks Team. If you have any questions about the data or relative researches, please contact us by email: liangyongbo@guet.edu.cn or liangyongbo001@gmail.com.
The CardioWorks Team focuses on PPG-based portable or wearable cardiovascular health detection and disease assessment. For more research datasets and published papers, please pay attention to the following:
